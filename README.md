# Advanced-Data-Network
In the spring of 2022, I enrolled in the course titled 'Advanced Data Networks' at Sharif University of Technology, under the guidance of Dr. Pakravan. Throughout the duration of this course, my responsibilities included designing a homework assignment based on the course syllabus and engaging in a research project.

Specifically, I focused on the topic of "Application of Machine Learning in Routing for Software Defined Networks." This repository serves as a comprehensive compilation of my research project, exploring the aforementioned subject, alongside the homework assignment I crafted. Both elements align with the curriculum of the 'Advanced Data Networks' course, which was expertly instructed by Dr. Pakravan at Sharif University of Technology during the spring semester of 2022.

It's important to note that this course was conducted in the Persian (Farsi) language.

## Research Methodology
My research methodology for investigating this topic involved a thorough review of all relevant surveys and review papers published over the past three years up to the present. Subsequently, I compiled a comprehensive report summarizing the key findings and insights from these sources.

## Overview of the Research Topic
Machine learning can be applied in routing for software-defined networks (SDN) to achieve better performance, network load balancing, and routing optimization. Here are some ways machine learning is being used in routing for SDN:
1. QoS-aware adaptive reinforcement learning routing method: This method was proposed in 2016 and combines routing algorithms with reinforcement learning to optimize routing in multi-layer hierarchical SDNs
2. Supervised learning: Supervised learning techniques are used to predict network traffic and optimize routing paths based on the predicted traffic
3. Artificial neural networks (ANN): ANN models can be trained to predict network traffic and optimize routing paths based on the predicted traffic
4. Self-organizing WLANs: Machine learning techniques can be used on top of SDN to identify feasible configurations and improve network resource usage and management
5. Intelligent routing algorithm: An intelligent routing algorithm based on machine learning was proposed in 2022 to solve the optimal multiobjective routing problem and improve network performance

Overall, the combination of machine learning technologies and routing algorithms is a promising direction for improving reachability, performance, and scalability in SDNs.
